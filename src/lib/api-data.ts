    value: `#### Starbucks' GHG Emission Reduction Targets and Compatibility with the 1.5°C Pathway

Starbucks has aligned its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets with the global aim as set by the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5°C. In January 2020, Starbucks pledged to become a resource-positive company by 2030, setting a goal to reduce its carbon, water, and waste footprints significantly. This pledge includes a 50% absolute cut in scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions across its operations and value chain. These targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative as compatible with the 1.5°C pathway, ensuring they are grounded in scientific standards.

#### Strategies for Emission Reduction

To reach these targets by 2030, Starbucks employs strategies intertwined with science and corporate values, including:

- Expansion of Plant-Based Menu Options: This reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional animal products.

- Transition to Reusable Packaging: Aims at eliminating single-use packaging waste.

- Investment in Regenerative Practices: Investing in regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and forest conservation.

Additionally, Starbucks leads initiatives such as pilot projects exploring innovative coffee processing methods, demonstrating its commitment to mitigating environmental impacts.

#### Governance and Progress Monitoring

The governance structure behind Starbucks' sustainability initiatives includes a Global Environmental Council. This council, comprising senior leaders, ties their compensation to achieving environmental targets, while the Board of Directors' Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight. Starbucks' reduction targets are periodically assessed to maintain alignment with international standards.

#### Commitment to Climate Justice

Starbucks incorporates a focus on social dynamics of climate change through principles of Inclusion, Resilience, and Just Transition. Through initiatives like the Global Farmer Fund, Starbucks promotes sustainable and equitable growth for communities most vulnerable to climate change effects.

#### Alignment with Global and Sectoral Pathways

Starbucks aligns its strategies with both sectoral decarbonisation pathways and global benchmarks. Participation in initiatives such as Transform to Net Zero illustrates Starbucks' resolve towards achieving a net zero global economy by 2050. The company adopts existing guidelines and scenarios into its climate strategies to address sectoral challenges effectively.
